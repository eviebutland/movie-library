### API
- Open API backend to define the routes and validation
- Fastify as the server, an alternative to ExpressJs [DOCS](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/main/docs/Guides/Getting-Started.md). I picked this as have used ExpressJs before and wanted to try something new.
- Pino pretty to make the fastify logs easier to read
- Fastify offers additional functionality such as Hooks which we can attach to events such as 'onRequest', these can be used to check Authentication/Authorisation. To add, they also have decorators which allow for customisation of the request/reply objects used in the HTTP lifescyle. [Decorators](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Decorators/#decorators), [Hooks](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Hooks/#hooks)

### Database
- Researched free AWS noSQL database [DynanmoDB](https://www.integrate.io/blog/dynamodb-vs-mongodb-differences/#four)
but decided that I want to learn how to secure the database and how to manage it myself. However, I do want to know more about AWS and its other services so planning on trialling DynanmoDB in the future.

- MongoDB Atlas - free noSQL document database in the cloud. Choose this as I have worked with MongoDB locally and will be able to build on my knowledge but not have as much of a steep learning curve as with DynanmoDB. To add, there was a [fastify/mongoDB plugin](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-mongodb). Selected AWS as the cloud provider and connected to new cluster in Mongo compass. 

- ACID transcations: need to be covered in this project but is supported by Mongo. We need to make sure that the database either fully completes the task or doesnâ€™t at all in order to ensure data is in the most consistent state

- Archive collection: I have created an archive collection for documents that have been soft deleted. I have done this because ...


#### Validation
AJV is used by Open API backend and Fastify behind the scenes to validate routes, operation IDs, requests and responses
 - [Fastify Validation](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Validation-and-Serialization/)

#### Authorisation and Authentication
For Authorisation I wanted to use JWT to follow the work project. JWT tokens allow for different roles/permissions where as API keys are application level.
