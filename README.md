### API
- Open API backend to define the routes and validation
- Fastify as the server, an alternative to expressJs [DOCS](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/main/docs/Guides/Getting-Started.md)
- Pino pretty to make the fastify logs easier to read

### Database
- Researched free AWS noSQL database [DynanmoDB](https://www.integrate.io/blog/dynamodb-vs-mongodb-differences/#four)
but decided that I want to learn how to secure the database and how to manage it myself. However, I do want to know more about AWS and its other services so planning on trialling DynanmoDB in the future.

- MongoDB Atlas - free noSQL document database in the cloud. Choose this as I have worked with MongoDB locally and will be able to build on my knowledge but not have as much of a steep learning curve as with DynanmoDB. To add, there was a [fastify/mongoDB plugin](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-mongodb). Selected AWS as the cloud provider and connected to new cluster in Mongo compass.
